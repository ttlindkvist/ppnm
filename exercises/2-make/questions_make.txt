1. What is the meaning of the following makefile variables
	$@, $<, $^, CFLAGS LDFLAGS LDLIBS
Answer:
	$@: the filename of the target
	$<: the name of the first prerequisite
	$^: the names of all the prerequisites with spaces between
	CFLAGS: extra flags to c compiler
	LDFLAGS: extra flags to linker
	LDLIBS:  libraries to link

2. the makefile will print
	CFLAGS
	FFLAGS
	FFLAGS
	-Wall -Ofast -std=c1x

Since $TEST = $(T)EST
and to reference a variable named TEST one must use  $(TEST)

3. all but 6 will compile and link the program
	1: implicit
	2: implicit
	3: implicit will not make a main.o
	4: implicit chain
	5: implicit chain
	6: will however compile and link with 'make main'
	7: complies and links in one go
	8: the same but with variables
	9: makes object files and then links them to an execuatable
