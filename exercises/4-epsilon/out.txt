sum down float=18.8079
Large discrepency since the float epsilon is rather large.     Summing up after a while, we are adding a small number to a large one, resulting in nothing done.
    But summing down means the following addition becomes more on the order of the previous sum, making addition possible.

This is the harmonic series, which does not converge.
sum up double=22.0648
sum down double=22.0648
