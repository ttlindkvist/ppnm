Practical Programming and Numerical Methods

Examination project in 'exam' folder.

All programs can be made by "make clean" and then "make".
Exercises as subfolders in the exercises folder with lecture number as prefix.
Homeworks in the homework folder - also very surprising
Homeworks and examination project all have a README for ease of navigation.
