Fit data to ln(y) = c_0 + c_1*x => y = exp(c_0)*exp(c_1*x) = a*exp(-gamma*x)
Coefficient vector c
 4.9586687 -0.1713794 

This gives the function: f(x) = 142.404*exp(-0.171379*x)

Covariance matrix S
 0.0008903 -0.0000875 
-0.0000875  0.0000125 

This gives an activity @ time 0: a = 142.404 +- 4.24899
And gamma = 0.171379 +- 0.00353553
Which gives a half-life of (4.04452 +- 0.0834378) d
Half-life for 224Ra = 3.63 d
Which is not terribly far away from our fitted value.
However it still outside the estimated uncertainty.
