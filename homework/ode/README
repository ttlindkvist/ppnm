Part A, B and C done.
Part A: see figures 'SIR.png' and 'SHM.png'
Part B: implementation of dynamic matrix in 'dyn_matrix.c'
Part C: three body and four body solutions in '3body.png' and '4body.png'

Output from program:
---- ODE HOMEWORK ----

The implemented runge-kutta is RK45.
If not stated otherwise the absolute and relative precision is 0.001 and 0.001 respectively
Since this method is very accurate the stepsize tends to increase so much that graphs become ugly
Therefore a max step size has been implemented

The intermediate points are stored in a dynamic matrix
------ SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION ------

Simple harmonic motion as a test. u''=-u
From 0 to 20 with max stepsize of 0.1
Steps taken: 202
Final size of dynamic matrix 250 2

--------- SIR model --------
(Tc, Tr) = (1, 14)
Steps taken: 203
Final size of dynamic matrix 250 3
(Tc, Tr) = (2, 14)
Steps taken: 203
Final size of dynamic matrix 250 3
(Tc, Tr) = (4, 14)
Steps taken: 203
Final size of dynamic matrix 250 3
Plots are generated, and as seen increasing the Tc, the time between contacts, means flattening the curve.

-------- NBODY ---------

First 3 bodies of forming a figure 8
Steps taken: 122
Final size of dynamic matrix 150 18

Now a 4 body solution almost forming an atomic symbol
Steps taken: 702
Final size of dynamic matrix 750 24
