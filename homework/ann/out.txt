Artificial Neural Network Homework
------ PART A --------
ANN with one hidden layer with 4 neurons
Done in C++ with an ANN class
Activation function is a gaussian wavelet
ANN is trained on a single set of points to fit the function cos(5x-1)*exp(-x*x)

Training took 10000 minimizing steps (with 10000 being max allowed pr. run)

------ PART B --------
A plot of the derivative together with the integral over -1 to x has been - plotB.png
