Artificial Neural Network Homework
------ PART A --------
ANN with one hidden layer with 10 neurons
Done in C++ with an ANN class with a randomized set of initial parameters
Activation function is a gaussian wavelet
ANN is trained on a single set of points

Training took 10000 minimizing steps (with 10000 being max allowed)
