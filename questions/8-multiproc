1. What is pthreads? Hint: man pthreads.
    an inteface for multithreaded processing

2. Which header files do you have to include in order to use pthreads? Hint: man pthread_create.
    #include<pthread.h>

3. Do you need any CFLAGS and/or LDLIBS to use pthreads?
    Compile and link with -pthread

4. How do you create a pthread?
    With pthread_create()

5. What is "thread-safe"? Hint: man pthreads|less --pattern=safe.
    Thread-safe is a process that safely delivers the same results even when run from multiple threads

9. Does your compiler support OpenMP?
    yes

10. What are the CFLAGS and LDLIBS for your installation of OpenMP?
    #include "omp.h"
    compiles with CFLAGS += -fopenmp -lgomp
    no need to link with anything
